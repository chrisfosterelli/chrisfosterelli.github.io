Two weeks of awesome.

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisfosterelli" target="_blank">Chris Foster</a>. I have a passion for code and technology, and in the coming fall I will be&nbsp;pursuing&nbsp;that passion professionally at <a href="http://www.tru.ca/" target="_blank">Thompson Rivers University</a>. In the mean time, I've been doing contract web application development to entertain myself.</p>

<p>Some few months ago, the <a href="http://lug.kamloops.net/" target="_blank">Kamloops Linux User Group</a>&nbsp;got a <a href="http://lug.kamloops.net/pipermail/lug_lug.kamloops.net/2012-March/007266.html" target="_blank">post</a>&nbsp;talking about "H4CK Night" events. It had been hard enough for me to find the Kamloops LUG group originally, and after seeing a year or so of&nbsp;inactivity&nbsp;on the list, that at some point in time I had come to imagine Kamloops as a dead tech city. <a href="http://youtu.be/MwvyhxWZzc4" target="_blank">I was so, so wrong.</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Cafe Motivo H4CK Night</p>
<p>After that, I attended a few more H4CK Nights and got to know all of the awesome people. Shortly after, me and <a href="https://twitter.com/thejonotron" target="_blank">Jonathan Bowers</a> went for lunch, and he set me up with my own space to work at in the KIC! As I come to the closing of the second week here, I'm realizing what a serious awesome work place this is.</p>
<p>In the first day, everyone on my side of the building introduced themselves. <em>Everyone </em>was interested in what I was doing, and I was seriously interested in what they were doing. I had never seen so many <a href="http://www.vocaba.com/" target="_blank">awesome</a> <a href="http://maps.nsifs.bc.ca/#cascades_district_overview" target="_blank">tech</a> <a href="http://www.itel.com/" target="_blank">companies</a> under one roof, much less a roof I expected to be in my own town.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://twitter.com/jaethan" target="_blank">Jaethan Reichel</a> loaned me a monitor and a&nbsp;keyboard&nbsp;for my setup.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the past two weeks, there has been countless times when workflow has frozen. We play games sometimes, we joke around, we play with Ipad apps, and we&nbsp;<em>have fun. </em>However, there has been other times when productivity escalates so much it shocks me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Being in an environment where I can constantly overhear conversations surrounding POST security, password hashing, and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">backbonejs</a> development is awesome. Working in a place like that is <em>amazing</em>. I've been <a href="https://twitter.com/thejonotron/status/226418210998722560/photo/1" target="_blank">warmly welcomed</a> by all the <a href="https://twitter.com/kicpeople" target="_blank">KIC people</a>, and am very much looking forward to the next few weeks!</p>
