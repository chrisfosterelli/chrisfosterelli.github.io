title: Discovering explosive productivity
---
<p>This friday is now my third week at the <a href="http://kicstart.ca/" target="_blank">Kamloops Innovation Centre</a>, and these last five days I have taken the time to reflect on how much more productive I have been since I've had the opportunity to set up here. Actually, not only productive, but how much more&nbsp;<em>efficient.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: center;">Something like this.</span></p>
<p>It turns out that when you stick a bunch of startup leaders and super-coders into one building, they all become very efficient at being, well, efficient.&nbsp;Cool tools take no time to spread around the whole office. Everyone always wants to share the latest method they found at working faster, better, and with more <em>style.</em>&nbsp;I have seen some seriously awesome tools in the last few weeks. Some of these I was already aware of, but I had <em>no idea</em> that they could be so powerful.</p>
<p>Tools like <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a>, <a href="https://workflowy.com/" target="_blank">WorkFlowy</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb" target="_blank">Vimium</a>&nbsp;have been brand new to me. These are all things that I wasn't aware of, and didn't sound totally useful upon first hearing about them, but now that I've seen them in action I have come realize how damn <span style="text-decoration: underline;">awesome</span>&nbsp;they are.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Trello just <em>looks </em>fun to use.</p>
<p>Other things I was perfectly aware of have been shown to me in a new light. I've now been reintroduced to the effectiveness of <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a>, and as a student I've even been shown how to get a&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/edu" target="_blank">free micro account</a>. Of course I've used it before, as every programmer should, but watching the workflow branch lines unfold on a whiteboard has reminded me of exactly how and why I <em>should </em>be using it. Applications I never would have thought of, like Excel, have also been shown to me to be capable of magical, magical things.</p>
<p>Some other things I learned havn't even been about tools. <a href="https://twitter.com/scottfoubister" target="_blank">Scott Foubister</a> reminded me that I shouldn't be hitting <strong>Ctrl+Alt+C+F1 </strong>five or six times a day, I should be <em>rebinding </em>it and not putting up with that sort of inconvience. I've also had an awesome discussion on using <a href="http://arvindn.livejournal.com/57651.html" target="_blank">caffeine as a tool</a>, instead of an addiction.</p>
<p>But I've also seen that everyone remembers to <em>balance</em>. Sleep is important, and so is play. In fact, sometimes the best thing to do is sit back and play a little <a href="http://www.minecraft.net/" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>, and here nobody has an issue doing that.</p>
<p>Now it's natural for people sharing the same interests to want to share interesting things, but I would have never expected the sort of impact it has made on my workflow. I have also become increadibly excited to head into this industry, as I see all of the awesome tools and workflow ideas that are possible for people working in teams. As a single coder, a lot of these methods aren't directly useful at the moment, but they definitely have me excited to use them in the future.</p>
