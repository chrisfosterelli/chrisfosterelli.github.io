title: Developers don't understand CORS
---

One of the best things about working in full stack consulting is that I get to 
work with a great number of developers with different skill levels in companies 
from various sizes and industries. This provides an opportunity to see what 
universal struggles come up. One that seems common and relevant recently is 
this: Too many web developers do not understand how CORS works.

<!-- Content Breaker -->

This seems particularly timely to point out because of the [recent Zoom 
vulnerability]. Security researcher Jonathan Leitschuh found Zoom has a web 
server listening on the machine at `http://localhost:19421`. When you load a 
Zoom link, Zoom's website sends a request to the localhost webserver and tells 
it to open up the native Zoom app. The whole article is worth a read, but these 
parts stuck out to me:

That last sentence is incorrect -- Chrome does [respect CORS headers] for 
localhost webservers. If you're a web developer you've probably done this when 
you have Create React App with your frontend app on one port and your backend 
API on another port. Your app is making cross origin requests against 
localhost, and this is supported in all browsers.

What this says to me is that Zoom may have needed to get this feature out and 
did not understand CORS. They couldn't make the AJAX requests without the 
browser disallowing the attempt. Instead, they built this image hack to work 
_around_ CORS.  By doing this, they opened Zoom up to a big vulnerability 
because not only can the Zoom website trigger operations in the native client 
and access the response, but every other website on the internet can too.

So what would a secure implementation of this feature look like? The webserver 
listening in on `localhost:19421` should implement a REST API and set a 
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header with the value `https://zoom.us`. This will 
ensure that only Javascript running on the zoom.us domain can talk to the 
localhost webserver. Further, to stop pages being able to open Zoom meetings 
automatically in the background zoom.us should have a [Content Security Policy] 
header that blocks rendering within an iframe.

This still leaves the vulnerability that any page can redirect your browser to 
a zoom.us link for a meeting that you didn't expect, but this is a user 
experience decision that Zoom has made rather than a software vulnerability. 
Personally, I think the approach is wrong here too. They mention they desired a 
better user experience by opening the application directly, but one of the 
rules of good user experience design is that your software must be predictable.

If I am clicking a link, I expect that it will not suddenly make my camera and 
microphone available to people I do not know. Zoom is breaking this 
expectation.  Even if they don't want the built-in browser popup for UX 
reasons, put this popup in-app! Google Meet does this well:

<img 
  src="image/developers-dont-understand-cors/meet.png"
  style="width: 75%; margin-left: 12.5%;">

I don't want to take away from the CORS focus of this post. Regardless of 
the user experience side of the argument, running a webserver on localhost is a 
risky endevour to begin with. It should absolutely not be providing privileged 
access to functions, such as _installing software_, to every website on the 
internet. CORS enables you to securely do this -- don't hack around it!

I can't know for sure if failure to understand CORS is why Zoom implemented the 
feature this way. However, I've talked to a few people and none of us can 
collectively find any legitimate reason to implement their existing approach.
On reddit, [lerunicorn did find and suggest] that Firefox may block XHRs from 
secure to non-secure origins which could explain the motivation behind this 
approach. However, Firefox supports this when the origin is localhost. Further, 
native apps can generate a unique self-signed certificate and install it. 
Alternatively, they could have used a [browser extension].  In any possible 
case, this is not a valid reason to forget to filter origins.

It's not just Zoom. Anecdotally, lots of developers I've talked with don't 
understand well how CORS works.  There's also very a [generous quantity of 
examples] from questions on Stack Overflow.  Unfortunately, these are often 
paired with pages that recommend very insecure defaults like [this one] in 
express which would make your application vulnerable if copied verbatim. Other 
vendors have been caught with the [exact same vulnerability] found in Zoom.

Developers just want to get their code to work, and bypassing the same-origin 
policy entirely might get it to work, but when someone finds out what you've 
done you'll get problems like Zoom has now.

I've seen CORS confusion from both experienced and new developers. Is the CORS 
API too complex and confusing, or do we only need better developer education 
around issues like CORS and CSP? I'm not sure, but the current approach 
definitely doesn't seem like it's working.
