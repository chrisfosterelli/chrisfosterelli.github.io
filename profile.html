<p>
  I'm the co-owner and chief technology officer at <a
  href="https://www.twostoryrobot.com/"> Two Story Robot</a>, a boutique
  consulting company specializing in web application development and machine
  learning. I recently completed my graduate degree in Computer Science at the
  <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/">University of Victoria</a>, where my research
  applied machine learning models to better understand how language is
  represented in the human brain.
