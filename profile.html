<h3>Hey there!</h3>

<img src="/image/social.jpg" class="profileimage">

<p>
  I'm a software engineer working at <a href="https://www.twostoryrobot.com/">
  Two Story Robot</a>, where I do web application consulting for public and 
  private organizations. I recently completed my graduate degree in Computer 
  Science at the <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/">University of Victoria</a>, 
  where my research was in applying machine learning models to better understand
  how language is represented and acquired in the human brain.

  This blog is a collection of some experiments in machine learning, software 
  development, and web application security. You can find me on
