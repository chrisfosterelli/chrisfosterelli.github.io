<h3>Hey there!</h3>

<img src="/image/social.jpg" class="profileimage">

<p>
  Iâ€™m a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Victoria, 
  working with <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/~afyshe/">Dr. Alona Fyshe</a>. My 
  research applies machine learning models to better understand how language is
  represented and acquired in the human brain. I also work with a great team at 
  <a href="https://www.twostoryrobot.com/">Two Story Robot</a>, where I do web 
  development consulting for startups and government organizations.

  This blog is a collection of some experiments in machine learning, software 
  development, and web application security. You can find me on
